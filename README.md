## Outage-State-Predictor
DSC80 Project for UCSD

By Albert Henderson

# Introduction

For this project, I will be analyzing a data set containing major power outages in the United State from January 2000 to July 2016. This dataset was obtained through Purdue University's Laboratory for Advancing Sustainable Critical Infrastructure, at https://engineering.purdue.edu/LASCI/research-data/outages.

This dataset contains various information about each power outage such as the State, climate, region, and postal code of the outage. As well as the number of people affected, the population of where it happened, and the cause of the major outage.

The purpose behind this project is that I want to answer the question, what regions in the U.S are most impacted by power outages. This question is meaningful to me as it can give insight into what parts of the country should be given resources in order to improve their electrical infrastrucutre.

This dataset has 1537 rows and 57 columns, however I will only be using these columns for this project

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Column        | Description   |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Year     | Year of the outage
| Month      | Month of the outage     |
| U.S._STATE | State the outage occured in      |
| Postal Code | The area code of the outage
| NERC.REGION| North American Electric Reliability Corporation Region the outage occured in|
